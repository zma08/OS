IBM 360 introduce time sharing

user--app--os--hardware(cpu,memory,i/o)

no computing system can be functional without os(1.manage resources 2. provide user interface)

kernel is running all the time once the computer turn on within the memory

kernel: is the central component of most computer operationg systems; it is a bridge between applications and the actual data processing done at the hardware level. the kernel's responsibilites include manageing the systems resources(the communication between hardware and software components)

OS: is a resource allocator/manager:
  1. manages all resources
  2. Decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
  3. OS is a control program that controls excution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer most of the time
  4. also provide a uniform user interface
---(kernel) Definition of OS varies. but the one program running at all times on the computer is the kernel, Everthing else is either a system progam or an application program

bootstrap rpogram: is loaded at power-up or reboot Typically stored in ROM  or EPROM, generally know as firmware
1. it initializes all aspects of system
2. loads operationg system kernel and starts execution by setting PC
